# V2.0

This is a working document related to the v2.0 of
the customizer UI plugin.

## V2 Goals

The main goal with V2 is to move away from a traditional
WordPress / PHP code style for building the admin pages, 
and instead towards using a JavaScript heavy front-end.
Leveraging the extendable WP REST API, we should be
able to create a more user-friendly front-end, and a more
enjoyable development environment, with faster iterations
on new features and bug fixes.

## Existing Features

Features that exist in v1.x that need to be in v2.0
prior to release:

- [x] Add Sections
- [x] Add Controls to Sections (all default types)
- [ ] Edit / Delete controls
- [ ] Edit / Delete / Duplicate sections
- [ ] Change priority of sections (including those created by theme / core)
- [x] Ability to hide/show sections
- [ ] Ability to hide/show core/theme sections
- [ ] Allow setting of a prefix for all controls
